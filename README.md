# SNR-impact-on-throughput
This project studies how the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) affects network throughput. Higher SNR gives better data transfer rates. Using the Shannon formula, it shows that improving signal quality boosts communication speed and supports SDG 9 â€“ Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.
